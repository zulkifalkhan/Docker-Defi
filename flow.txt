-create an api for getting transaction and verfiying it
-so create a node server
-create an endpoint for transaction creation and then for verfiying as well
-use gRPC for all the communications and see how all of it will work
-also add a filehandling function which adds a tx to the end of a file as a blockchain ledger
-so basically the flow is like this:

1- frontend uses react to have a good UI so then i can add on upwork as well (this might be done in v2)
2-it will uses gRPC for communcation between endpoints
3-so suppose 3-4 nodes are running all of them will be runinng using a dockerfile which will turn it to an image 
which will then be running in their containers. All of these will be achieved using docker-compose which ultimatelty
is a container orchestration on a beginner level amaybe. This will also use docker networking concepts which will help
to run all the conatiners by using docker bridge network which will help each of the image running (node server) to discover
the other images running. Then we will use gRPC to communicate in between them.
4- Then we will need to know how they will work together and i think each of them will kind of work like p2p so basically as
a server and a client.
5- so for verficaiton the algo might be like each of the server will get a request of a tx and then user will look into the 
file and see if the from the right source and for that we will need to use cryptography and pub/private key concept
6-once verifed then store the tx and send the response back to the user frontend an


 
* tx  = transaction
